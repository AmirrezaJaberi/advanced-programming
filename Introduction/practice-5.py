## Practice 5 :
# Program to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n

# Input the value of n
n = 10  # Replace with any value of n you want to calculate

# Initialize sum to zero
total = 0

# Loop through numbers from 1 to n and add them to total
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    total += i

# Print the result
print(f"The sum of numbers from 1 to {n} is:", total)
